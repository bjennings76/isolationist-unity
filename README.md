# Isolate Selected in Editor

Isolationist is a small Unity Editor utility that allows you to toggle selected assets into an Isolate mode similar to `Tools > Isolate Select` in Maya where all other objects are hidden while you are editing the selected objects. This makes the objects you've isolated easiser to work with and keeps you from accidentally selecting/editing objects you aren't working on.

##To Use
- Install from the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/57758) 
- Or open this project in Unity
- Or copy the `Assets/Plugins` folder into the `Assets` folder in your own Unity project

##To Enter Isolate Mode
- Select the object or objects you want to isolate
- Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>I</kbd>
- Or use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`

##To Exit Isolate Mode
- Select a hidden object in the heirarchy
- Or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>I</kbd>
- Or use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`

##To Modify the Keyboard Shortcut
- Open `Edit > Preferences... > Isolationist`
