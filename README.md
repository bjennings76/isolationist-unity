# Isolationist Editor Command

Isolationist is a small Unity Editor utility that allows you to toggle selected assets into an Isolate mode similar to `Tools > Isolate Select` in Maya where all other objects are hidden while you are editing the selected objects.

This makes the isolated objects easiser to work with and keeps you from accidentally selecting objects you aren't working on.

To Use:
- Install from the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/57758) 
- Or open this project in Unity
- Or copy the `Assets/Plugins` folder into the `Assets/Plugins` folder in your own Unity project

To Enter Isolate Mode:
- Select the object or objects you want to isolate
- Use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`
- Or use the keyboard shortcut (`I` by default)

To Exit Isolate Mode:
- Use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`
- Or use the keyboard shortcut (`I` by default)
- Or select a hidden object in the heirarchy

To Modify the Keyboard Shortcut:
- Open `Edit > Preferences... > Isolationist` 
- Select the desired base key and modifiers
